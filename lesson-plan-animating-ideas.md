# Lesson Plan: Animating Ideas with Scratch

## Background

At STEM night, our principal challenged me to collect and share ideas for the new Slackwood STREAM Lab with her.  There's only one problem: I need exciting ideas!  As the year is drawing to a close, I'd love to hear what students think such a space should be used for, and can help deliver them in a compelling way.

## Objectives

* Students will exercise design thinking by selecting three ideas, a visual representation of each, and a sequence for presentation.
* Students will modify an existing Scratch project, add characters (sprites), and use programming blocks to animate the characters on screen to express three ideas.

## Standards

* 8.1.2.B.1 Illustrate and communicate original ideas and stories using multiple digital tools and resources.

## Materials[^1]

* Slideshow of STREAM Activity Examples
* Project Design Handouts
* Pencils
* Chromebooks with https://scratch.mit.edu accessible, Starter Scratch Project (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/302697572/)
* Classroom Projection

## Method

1. Discuss STREAM Activity Examples.
2. Explore project template.
3. Generate ideas for presentation.
4. Search for icons representative of ideas.
5. Insert descriptive text and icons.
6. Modify music, effects, and sequence of animation.
 
## Assessment

* A design handout with some combination of three ideas, an explaination of their connection to STREAM themes, and a consideration of their presentation and sequence within an existing animation template.
* A completed remixed Scratch project that incorporates and presents the three ideas in a meaningful sequence integrated with the starter template.

## Adaptations

* For students with experience using and creating with Scratch, this lesson can be adapted to have students develop new template material and then add their ideas atop an entirely original computer-generated animation.
